#   Before you begin coding, write an algorithm that represents the steps necessary to #   play a game of rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock in a best-of-three format. By #   writing out the steps, it will make you think about every piece needed to bring the #   game to life. Please submit to your instructor Slack channel once completed for  #   approval to start coding. Below is an example of how to get started:
